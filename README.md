- ```webpack.config.js``` formatting
- ```package.json``` formatting
- Learned basic Adobe xD to mock up what the site should look like since it is built dynamically.
- Importing multiple CSS files via Webpack (```style.css``` and ```reset.css```)
- The benefit of using 'components' for code readability, code reuse and updating code.


### Functionality:
